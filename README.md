# Project Pokemon Randomizer:

* **1. About**

	* Once you access the webpage, a random Pokemon, with its own information and picture, will be displayed. There are 1024 different Pokemons. Originally the project was more ambitious. It was supposed to let the person choose which Pokemon to display among other things, but I run out of time before the deadline.

* **Project Setup**
	* a. Set up a Node.js project using Express.js
	* b. Uses Axios for making HTTP requests.
	* c. Uses EJS and CSS for templating and style.

* **API Integration**
	* a. Uses Axios to send HTTP requests to the Pokemon API https://pokeapi.co
 
* **2. How to use**
	* a. Once the files are downloaded to your project. Use "npm i" to install all its dependencies. 
	* b. To run the server use the command "nodemon index.js".
