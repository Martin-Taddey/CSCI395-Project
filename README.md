# Project Pokemon Randomizer:
* **About the Project**

	* Once you access the webpage, a random Pokemon with its own information will be displayed. There are 1024 different Pokemons.

		We chose this dataset because car accidents are common in NYC. We believe it is important to analyze the data to understand what measures can be taken to reduce car accidents.
 
	* b. What was your dataset about?

		What were some of the important columns in your data and why are they important? 
		Our dataset details the information of motor vehicle collisions in New York City from 2016 to 2021. One of the important columns is “collision id,” as it assigns an unique ID to each accident that occurred. Other important columns are crash date and number of pedestrians, cyclists, motorists injured and killed. These columns show the number of injuries and fatalities from car accidents. At the same time, they show why it is important to prevent car accidents from happening.

	* c. What kind of things did you want to explore about your data? 

		First, we wanted to explore the dataset to understand why, when, and how the motor vehicle collisions are happening. Then, we analyzed the data obtained to identify the dates and places where they occurred the most, and the amount of people who got injured or killed classified by transportation, among other things.

* **2. How to use**
	* a. Why did you ask this question? Was there any information you wanted to learn? 
	* b. Did you succeed in answering the question? If you did succeed, what did you learn? If you weren’t successful, can you propose a method which might help solve the question (i.e. different data, or using a different tool than SQL etc.)?
	* c. Which SQL tool(s) did you use to solve the question (i.e. aggregates, joins, cases etc.)?
